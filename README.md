# Analysis-based-in-metrics-and-cohorts

This repository provides a sample of my capabilities in performing Data analysis using cohort analysis and answering questions through the estimation of metrics. The project is a simulated analysis with the following objectives:

<li>Identify how customers use the service
<li>Estimate when they begin making purchases
<li>Calculate how much revenue each customer generates for the company
<li>Estimate when revenues offset customer acquisition costs
<h2>The Analysis:</h2>
consisted of various steps such as the following: 
General data sets inspection and preparation, descriptive statistic analysis to estimate the distributions of visits and number of users on the website per time period. A cohort analysis was performed to analyse the purchases of users over time and the user retention percentage. A conversion rate was estimated from visitors to customers. Finaly, a cohort analysis was performed to evaluate the return on investment of marketing per source.
<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<li>Identify how customers use the service:
  The analysis revealed two main customer behaviours. Most users visit the website only once and do not return. A smaller segment of customers continues to return in the following months. Additionally, most customers who make a purchase do so on the same day as their first visit.
The highest customer activity was observed in November 2017.

<li>Estimate when customers begin purchasing:
  Customers tend to make their first purchase on the same day they visit the website for the first time.

<li>Calculate how much revenue each customer contributes to the company.

  Customers who visit only once spend an average of 4.80 USD In contrast, returning customers contribute approximately 14 USD on average.

<li>Estimate when revenues offset customer acquisition costs: 

  Since only a small proportion of users continue purchasing, monthly marketing costs are nearly covered by the revenue generated from users who purchase within that same month. Only Sources 1 and 2 generate enough revenue to exceed marketing costs and show some profit. The remaining sources have high Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC), and their revenues do not cover marketing expenses. Even when analysing cumulative revenue per cohort over the cohortâ€™s lifetime, many cohorts fail to offset marketing costs several months after acquisition.
